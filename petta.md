Typical Rajinikanth movie. Full on fun from start to finish. 

Kaali, a hostel warden joins a college hostel and tries to protect a student who is a son of his best friend while he was growing up. Movie then shows flashback of petta velan (Kaali) and his friend anwar and how anwar died. Second half is where the villian from the flashback (Nawazuddin siddiqui) known as Singaram tries to kill Anwar's son.
Vijaysethupathy is Singaram's son. Velan plays a prank by saying that Vijaysethupathy (Jittu) is his son. He believes it and goes on help Velan kill Singaram. At the end, velan reveals the secret to Jittu and kills him
